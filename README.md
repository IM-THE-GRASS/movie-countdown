 The app uses the [MCU countdown API](https://github.com/DiljotSG/MCU-Countdown) which relies on the [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).

 The site itselF was made using a full stack python webdev framework called [reflex](https://reflex.dev) and although it is nothing special, I may add compatibilty for user selected movies and many UI improvments
